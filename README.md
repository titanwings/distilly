</div>

Distilly is a local-first product for turning a person's source material, working habits, judgment, and voice into a versioned **Person Profile for Agents**. The profile can be recalled temporarily during a run or explicitly installed as a long-lived host Skill. The storage authority stays local; no additional model API key is required.

This `distilly-plugin` branch carries the unreleased `0.1.0-preview.1` Developer Preview; the repository's default branch is `dot-skill`, the separate legacy implementation, so a bare clone lands on that line instead of this one. Codex, OpenClaw `2026.3.24`, and Hermes `v0.9.0` each have an immutable real-host transport-capacity fixture. The OpenClaw and Hermes measurements use a deterministic synthetic fixture server through the real host executable, model, and MCP transport; they do not by themselves certify packaged restart or the full product lifecycle. Setup remains fail-closed for any unrecorded host version or changed release tuple. This branch is not a tagged release or an npm package yet.

## Install the Developer Preview

### For an agent

Give your coding agent the following task and let it run the commands in a fresh checkout:

> Install the Distilly Developer Preview from the `distilly-plugin` branch, build it with Node 22.19+ (or Node 24), run `distilly setup --host codex`, run `distilly doctor --host codex`, and report the result. Do not modify another branch.

The exact checkout and setup commands are shown below so the agent can verify every step.

### For a human

Requirements: Node.js `22.19+` or `24`, pnpm `10.32+`, and a locally installed Codex CLI. From a terminal:

```bash
git clone --branch distilly-plugin https://github.com/titanwings/distilly.git
cd distilly
corepack enable
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run build
node packages/cli/lib/bin.js setup --host codex
node packages/cli/lib/bin.js doctor --host codex
```

Restart Codex after setup. The launcher registers the self-contained Plugin and its five MCP tools. To remove the host integration while keeping all local people, profiles, and source data:

```bash
node packages/cli/lib/bin.js uninstall --host codex
```

To install one approved profile as a persistent Skill after a profile has been created, use its exact subject id:

```bash
node packages/cli/lib/bin.js install subject_<32 lowercase hex characters> --host codex
```

## Host compatibility and explicit Legacy fallback

Codex uses the native Plugin preview above. The Preview also includes compatibility bindings for OpenClaw and Hermes:

- **OpenClaw** loads the Claude-compatible bundle from `~/.openclaw/extensions/distilly` and its real `.mcp.json`. Check discovery with `openclaw plugins inspect distilly --json`.
- **Hermes** installs the canonical Skill at `~/.hermes/skills/distilly`, a managed wrapper at `~/.distilly/bin/distilly-hermes`, and an MCP entry in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`. `resources` and `prompts` are disabled so the exposed surface remains five tools; check it with `hermes mcp test distilly`.

The CLI recognizes both hosts and enables setup when the installed version matches the recorded real-host transport fixture. The current net budgets, measured in isolated clean sessions with `openai-codex/gpt-5.4`, are 65,536 serialized bytes for OpenClaw and 49,752 for Hermes (the same conservative byte/token accounting used by the Codex fixture). These are transport/value lower bounds for the recorded probe, not a guarantee of remaining context in every model or user session. Any unrecorded version, release digest, tool descriptor, or serializer tuple returns `host_unsupported` before writing an unverified integration. There is no automatic switch to the legacy implementation.

Until a host has a verified Plugin binding, you can explicitly choose the maintained `dot-skill` branch as a **Legacy Skill compatibility mode**:

> Install Distilly in Legacy Skill compatibility mode from the `dot-skill` branch into this host's normal Skills directory, using a clean checkout whose final directory is named `distilly`. Verify discovery and report the installed Git commit. Do not run Plugin setup or claim SQLite, five-tool MCP, Panel, or Plugin lifecycle support.

For a manual install, replace `<target-directory>` with the complete final path in the [detailed install guide](INSTALL.md), including the last `distilly` component, and create its parent first:

```bash
git clone --single-branch --branch dot-skill --depth 1 \
  https://github.com/titanwings/distilly.git \
  <target-directory>
git -C <target-directory> rev-parse HEAD
```

This is an explicit, separate file-based implementation—not an automatic runtime fallback. It does not share a supported data model with the Plugin, and a failed Plugin preflight never switches modes. The compatibility promise currently covers local files and pasted text only. Do not enable legacy collectors while the Plugin uses the same home directory: current legacy collectors can write credential configuration into the same `~/.distilly/` namespace and remain outside the Preview's reviewed security boundary. Keep exactly one `distilly` active in any host discovery scope and verify which copy the host loaded.

## The first usable flow

On Codex, the complete flow below is verified. OpenClaw `2026.3.24` and Hermes `v0.9.0` have the same briefing transport path verified against their recorded capacity fixture; their packaged restart, long-lived Skill, and uninstall lifecycle checks remain separate. Restart the selected host and ask it to research and distill a person. Supply only the files, text, or public URLs you want included. Distilly then:

1. resolves or creates the person;
2. imports the selected material with deterministic local parsers;
3. creates a pending research job and a complete evidence-bound briefing;
4. commits a versioned Person Profile;
5. returns the profile or a complete temporary prompt for the current run;
6. accepts an explicit correction and sends a candidate to review;
7. lets you promote, reject, or roll back the candidate in the local Panel; and
8. installs the approved profile as a self-contained host Skill when you ask it to.

The model-facing surface remains exactly five MCP tools:

`distilly_get` · `distilly_ingest` · `distilly_pending` · `distilly_commit` · `distilly_correct`

Distilly never silently truncates a complete briefing or profile prompt. If a verified host budget cannot carry the complete value, it reports a bounded capacity error with measurements and keeps the stored data unchanged.

## Host status

| Host | Native Plugin | Current compatibility route |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | Fully verified in this release branch | Native Plugin |
| Claude Code | Binding included; exact host fixture still needed | Explicit `dot-skill` Legacy Skill |
| OpenClaw | Transport-capacity fixture recorded for `2026.3.24` (65,536-byte net budget); lifecycle pending | Claude-compatible bundle + discovery smoke |
| Hermes | Transport-capacity fixture recorded for `v0.9.0` (49,752-byte net budget); lifecycle pending | Managed Skill + MCP configuration |
| DeepSeek Harness (DSH) | Community binding planned | Explicit `dot-skill` Legacy Skill |
| Pi agent | Community binding planned | Explicit `dot-skill` Legacy Skill |
| Grok Build | Community binding planned | Explicit `dot-skill` Legacy Skill |
| OpenCode | Community binding planned | Explicit `dot-skill` Legacy Skill |
| Grok Bot | Community binding planned | Manual saved/private Skill only; local repository import is not claimed |

Host compatibility is a binding concern. Legacy Skill discovery is useful continuity, but it does not make a host a verified Plugin target.

## Local material formats

The first Preview accepts explicit local `TXT`, `Markdown`, `JSON`, and `SRT/VTT` files. It also accepts pasted text and public URLs through the host's visible research flow. Files are read only from the paths or sources the user supplies; symlinked selected files and duplicate file names are rejected. PDF, email, provider exports, and hosted connectors are follow-up work.

## 📣 2026-09 update: help expand coding-agent Plugins

Codex, OpenClaw, and Hermes now have real host/version capacity fixtures. We need community support to provide the same evidence for **Claude Code, DeepSeek Harness (DSH), Pi agent, Grok Build, OpenCode, and Grok Bot**, then to build and validate their coding-agent Plugin packages. I will actively review those contributions and keep the public contracts, release digests, and host behavior aligned.
