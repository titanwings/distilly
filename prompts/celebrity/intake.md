# 名人 Intake Prompt（中文要点）

> 英文正文见下方 `## English` 段。两段的命令引用必须一致，锚点格式统一为 `[k00NN]` / `[k00NN:tM]`。

名人蒸馏的 intake：确认人物、research profile（默认 `budget-friendly`）与采集策略（local-first / web+local / web-only），支持"按人名直连"或"先做诊断子流程"两条入口；输出中包含冷门人物判定。

## 必须

1. 先列"读了哪些文件、各多少条、多少锚点"，再写结论。
2. 每条结论跟 `文件 + 锚点`（`[k00NN]` 或 `[k00NN:tM]`），例如 `knowledge/text/feishu.md [k0042]`。
3. 先跑 `distilly retrospect`，再读 `evidence/derived/*`；派生结论按候选处理。
4. 第 4 个问题必须确认 `research_profile`（`budget-friendly` / `budget-unfriendly`）与采集策略，不能默认跳过。
5. intake 阶段就要记录冷门人物判定（总来源 < 10 条时后续心智模型限制为 2–3 个）。
6. 用户没提供的字段留空并写 `unknown`，不要替用户推断身份、职业或立场。

## 禁止

1. 禁止无证据推断：印象、常识、模型记忆都不能当结论。
2. 禁止改写引文；长段原文、完整 transcript、完整字幕一律不得进仓库。
3. 禁止把 key 写进对话或文件；凭据只从 `~/.distilly/*_config.json` 或环境变量读取。
4. 禁止自己拼 API 请求；网络采集只走 `distilly collect`。
5. 禁止把候选（candidate）当结论。
6. 禁止把候选人物（诊断子流程给出的名字）当作已确认对象开始采集。

## 回执

- 读过哪些文件、各多少条、多少锚点。
- 生成/更新了哪些文件，各自 sha256（来自 `distilly` 的 `--json` 回执、`knowledge/index.json` 或 `evidence/renders/receipt.json`）。
- 哪些渠道不可用（`unavailable[]`）。
- 哪些步骤没跑、为什么。

# Celebrity Intake Prompt

## Goal

Collect enough information to launch a research-first celebrity distillation workflow,
while actively helping users who are unsure about who to distill or what they need.

---

## Entry Routing

Detect the user's intent and route accordingly:

### Direct Path

User names a specific person (e.g., "distill Paul Graham", "做一个张一鸣的 Skill").

→ Go straight to Q1–Q5 below.

### Diagnostic Path

User describes a vague need without naming a person (e.g., "I want someone who's
good at product thinking", "我想找一个能帮我做投资决策的人").

→ Run the diagnostic sub-flow before Q1.

---

## Diagnostic Sub-Flow (only when no specific person is named)

### Round 1: Identify the dimension

```text
You haven't named a specific person. Let me help you find the right one.

What kind of thinking do you need help with?

Examples:
- Product decisions and taste
- Investment and risk judgment
- Engineering and systems design
- Communication and persuasion
- Creative writing and storytelling
- Management and team building
- Scientific thinking and explanation
```

Capture:
- domain / thinking dimension
- whether the user prefers a specific era, culture, or language

### Round 2: Narrow and recommend

Based on the user's dimension, recommend 2–3 candidates. Prioritize:
1. People already distilled as existing Skills in the system
2. People with abundant public material (books, long interviews, documented decisions)
3. People whose thinking is distinctive enough to produce a high-quality Skill

```text
Based on what you described, here are some candidates:

1. {Name A} — {one-line reason}
2. {Name B} — {one-line reason}
3. {Name C} — {one-line reason}

Who sounds right? Or name someone else.
```

Once the user picks, proceed to Q1.

---

## Opening (Direct Path)

```text
I'll help you distill a public figure into a Skill. Answer 5 questions. Every question except Q1 is skippable.
```

---

## Questions

### Q1: Who is it

```text
Who do you want to distill?

Examples:
- Steve Jobs
- Naval Ravikant
- 张一鸣
- Charlie Munger
- Richard Feynman
```

Capture:
- canonical name
- aliases
- likely language / region
- whether this person is well-known (abundant material) or relatively obscure

### Q2: Why this person

```text
What do you want from this person's Skill?

Examples:
- how they make decisions
- how they think about products
- how they explain complex ideas
- how they judge people and tradeoffs
- how they approach risk and uncertainty
```

Capture:
- use case
- desired lens / focus area
- output bias: strategy / expression / explanation / judgment / creativity

### Q3: Any known materials

```text
Do you already have source material? Books, interviews, talks, posts, podcasts, articles, screenshots — anything is fine.

If you have local files (PDF, transcripts, subtitle files, screenshots), mention them now.
```

Capture:
- local materials (files the user can provide directly)
- URLs of specific known sources
- known books / talks / interviews by title
- whether this should run in local-first mode

### Q4: Collection strategy

Based on Q3, determine and confirm the collection strategy:

```text
Based on what you've told me, I'll use this collection approach:

  [A] Local-first: You have substantial local material. I'll analyze that first,
      then only search the web for missing dimensions.

  [B] Web + local: You have some material. I'll combine it with web research.

  [C] Web-only: No local material. I'll do a full web research pass.

Sound right? (confirm / change)
```

The three strategies affect how Phase 1 research allocates effort:
- **Local-first**: Analyze provided materials first, map which of the 6 dimensions are covered, only search web for gaps
- **Web + local**: Run full 6-dimension web research, then merge with local materials, use local as ground truth where they overlap
- **Web-only**: Standard 6-dimension web research pass

### Q5: Research depth

```text
Which research profile?

- budget-friendly: faster, lighter, 3-track minimum
- budget-unfriendly: slower, deeper, 6-track with audit + synthesis + validation gates

Default: budget-friendly
```

Capture:
- requested research profile
- whether the user prefers speed or confidence

---

## Cold Figure Detection

After Q1, estimate whether this person has sufficient public material.

Signals of a cold figure:
- no Wikipedia page or very short one
- no published books or long-form interviews
- limited to social media presence only
- user cannot name specific works or talks

If cold figure is detected:

```text
⚠️ Note: {name} appears to have limited public material.

This means:
- Mental models will be limited to 2–3 (instead of 3–7)
- Some dimensions may be marked as "based on limited information"
- The honest boundaries section will be larger than usual

This is fine — an honest 60-point Skill beats a fabricated 90-point one.

Continue? (yes / switch to someone else)
```

---

## Output Summary

```text
Summary:

  Person: {name}
  Region/Language: {region}
  Main goal: {goal}
  Known sources: {source_summary}
  Collection strategy: {local-first / web+local / web-only}
  Research profile: {research_profile}
  Cold figure: {yes/no}

Confirm? (confirm / edit [field])
```

---

## MUST

1. First list which files were read, how many rows each, and how many anchors; only then write conclusions.
2. Every conclusion carries `file + anchor` (`[k00NN]` or `[k00NN:tM]`), e.g. `knowledge/text/feishu.md [k0042]`.
3. Run `distilly retrospect` first, then read `evidence/derived/*`; treat derived patterns as candidates.
4. The fourth question must confirm `research_profile` (`budget-friendly` / `budget-unfriendly`) and the collection strategy; never skip it silently.
5. Record the cold-figure verdict during intake (below 10 total sources, later mental models are limited to 2–3).
6. Fields the user did not supply stay empty and are `unknown`; never infer identity, profession, or stance.

## MUST NOT

1. No evidence-free inference: impressions, common sense, and model memory are not conclusions.
2. Never rewrite quotations; long passages, full transcripts, and full subtitles never enter the repository.
3. Never write credentials into chat or files; they are read only from `~/.distilly/*_config.json` or environment variables.
4. Never hand-craft API calls; all network collection goes through `distilly collect`.
5. Never present a candidate as a conclusion.
6. Never start collection on a candidate name from the diagnostic sub-flow before the user confirms the person.

## RECEIPT

- Which files were read, how many rows each, how many anchors.
- Which files were created or updated, each with its sha256 (from the `distilly` `--json` receipt, `knowledge/index.json`, or `evidence/renders/receipt.json`).
- Which channels were unavailable (`unavailable[]`).
- Which steps were skipped, and why.
