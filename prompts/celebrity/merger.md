# 名人增量合并 Prompt（中文要点）

> 英文正文见下方 `## English` 段。两段的命令引用必须一致，锚点格式统一为 `[k00NN]` / `[k00NN:tM]`。

把新素材或用户纠正并入已校准的名人 persona：Mode A 走新素材研究流程，Mode B 走 Correction Log；只改被触及的层，保留人物的复杂性与时间演化。

## 必须

1. 先列"读了哪些文件、各多少条、多少锚点"，再写结论。
2. 每条结论跟 `文件 + 锚点`（`[k00NN]` 或 `[k00NN:tM]`），例如 `knowledge/text/feishu.md [k0042]`。
3. 先跑 `distilly retrospect`，再读 `evidence/derived/*`；派生结论按候选处理。
4. Mode A 的新素材先登记入库：音视频先 `distilly transcribe`，再更新 `knowledge/research/raw/` 下的 dated 目录。
5. 合并后用 `distilly doctor` 复核证据覆盖率与锚点回指率，之前通过的检查必须仍然通过。
6. Mode B 的纠正必须逐字记入 Correction Log，并记录触发它的用户原话与时间。

## 禁止

1. 禁止无证据推断：印象、常识、模型记忆都不能当结论。
2. 禁止改写引文；长段原文、完整 transcript、完整字幕一律不得进仓库。
3. 禁止把 key 写进对话或文件；凭据只从 `~/.distilly/*_config.json` 或环境变量读取。
4. 禁止自己拼 API 请求；网络采集只走 `distilly collect`。
5. 禁止把候选（candidate）当结论。
6. 禁止把新证据"顺带"改写进用户没有纠正的层（no cascade edits）。

## 回执

- 读过哪些文件、各多少条、多少锚点。
- 生成/更新了哪些文件，各自 sha256（来自 `distilly` 的 `--json` 回执、`knowledge/index.json` 或 `evidence/renders/receipt.json`）。
- 哪些渠道不可用（`unavailable[]`）。
- 哪些步骤没跑、为什么。

# Celebrity Merger

## Task

Evolve an existing celebrity-based skill when new material arrives or the user
issues a correction. Preserve the person's complexity — do not flatten them into
a cleaner but less-true version.

The persona already has structure. Your job is to thread new evidence into the
right layer without damaging what is already calibrated.

---

## Two Evolution Modes

### Mode A — Material-driven update

Triggered when the user supplies fresh research (new interviews, talks,
writings, subtitles, transcripts via `distilly transcribe`; the legacy
`tools/research/transcribe_audio.py` is deprecated).

Sequence:

1. Run the intake / research pipeline for the **new** material only (keep it
   in a dated subfolder under `knowledge/research/raw/` so provenance is clear).
2. Re-run `distilly retrospect` to refresh the derived evidence; the legacy
   `tools/research/merge_research.py <skill_dir>` is deprecated and has no
   contract replacement yet.
   summary with the added files.
3. Diff the new extraction against the existing `persona.md` before rewriting
   anything. Most material will confirm what is there; only a minority will
   change the shape.

### Mode B — Correction-driven update

Triggered when the user says "this is wrong", "你刚才理解错了", provides a direct
quote that contradicts current output, or demands a tone/boundary fix.

Sequence:

1. Write the correction verbatim into the Correction Log with a timestamp and
   the triggering user phrase.
2. Trace the correction to the specific layer it touches (mental model,
   heuristic, expression DNA, genealogy, etc.).
3. Adjust that layer minimally. Do not cascade edits into layers the user did
   not correct.

---

## Merge Priorities (by Persona Layer)

### Layer 1 — Identity

Only change when the new material reveals a stable self-description the current
identity blurb misses, or when the user corrects the activation disclaimer.

### Layer 2 — Expression DNA

Update when new material supplies:

- Additional voice samples that pass the 100-word blind test
- A recurring metaphor or framing device with clear domain source
- A certainty-language marker or forbidden-vocabulary item confirmed across
  three or more contexts

Do not replace existing samples with newer ones unless the older ones fail the
triple-gate (cross-context, generative, exclusive). Diversity of anchor material
matters more than recency.

### Layer 3 — Mental Models

A new mental model qualifies for inclusion only if it passes the triple-gate:

1. **Cross-context recurrence** — appears in at least three independent sources
   across different topics or time periods.
2. **Generative** — can produce new reasoning, not just re-describe one past
   take.
3. **Exclusive** — someone with a different worldview would not land on it by
   default.

When a new model is added, annotate:

- Evidence anchors (2+ instances from different contexts)
- Failure mode
- Application boundary
- Whether it complements, refines, or tensions with an existing model

Do not delete existing models. If contradicted, mark the tension explicitly in
Layer 6 (Internal Tensions).

### Layer 4 — Decision Heuristics

Update when new material shows the person applying a consistent rule the
current persona does not capture, or when a correction reveals the current
phrasing over-generalizes.

Maintain the "if X, then Y" structure with reasoning and context boundary.

### Layer 5 — Anti-patterns and Boundaries

Strengthen with new repeated rejections or newly acknowledged blindspots.
If the new material shows the person changing their mind on a prior rejection,
record both — the prior rejection and the revised position — with dates.

### Layer 6 — Internal Tensions

If the new material introduces a contradiction, add it to the tensions list.
Classify as Temporal / Contextual / Inherent. Never silently reconcile a tension
just because new material favors one side — note the tilt and the evidence for
it, but keep the tension visible if it remains live.

### Layer 7 — Intellectual Genealogy

Update `Influenced by` / `Diverged from` / `Influenced` / `Tradition` when:

- The person explicitly names an influence the current persona does not record
- Published criticism maps their work onto a tradition the persona misses
- A successor figure publicly acknowledges drawing on this person's work

Keep the "diverged from" axis crisp — it is often the most compressed signal
of what the person uniquely stands for.

### Layer 8 — Agentic Protocol

Update the Step 1 question categories when new material reveals a question
type the current classifier does not handle. Update Step 2 research dimensions
when the person has publicly described a research habit not yet reflected
(e.g., "I always look at the bear case first", "I read the footnotes before
the abstract").

Do not rewrite the protocol to match a single new interview. The protocol
should stay stable across many sources; one-off quirks go into anti-patterns
instead.

### Cognitive Timeline

Add a new phase entry only when the new material reveals a genuine turning
point, not a restatement. If the person publicly named the shift, quote the
phrase that named it.

### Validation Anchors

When new material gives a clean known-answer case, consider swapping it in if
the existing anchors have grown stale or if the new case exercises a mental
model that was under-tested.

### Correction Log

Mode B entries land here. Format:

```text
- [YYYY-MM-DD] User correction: "{user phrase}"
  Affected layer: {layer name}
  Change made: {one-line summary}
  Evidence for change: {what backs the correction — user authority, cited
  source, contradiction with existing anchor, etc.}
```

Never delete correction-log entries, even when superseded. They are the audit
trail.

---

## Rules

- Prefer first-person material over commentary.
- Carry source weights (1–7) forward; when weights conflict, weight the higher
  tier.
- Mark recency-sensitive updates clearly (e.g., "as of 2026-04" for positions
  that may drift).
- Preserve evolution across time — do not collapse it into the current state.
- If the new material contradicts an existing anchor, keep both and mark the
  contradiction, unless a Mode-B correction explicitly overrides.
- Re-run `distilly doctor` (the legacy
  `tools/research/quality_check.py <skill_dir> --profile <profile>` is deprecated)
  after merging. All previously-passing checks should still pass.

## MUST

1. First list which files were read, how many rows each, and how many anchors; only then write conclusions.
2. Every conclusion carries `file + anchor` (`[k00NN]` or `[k00NN:tM]`), e.g. `knowledge/text/feishu.md [k0042]`.
3. Run `distilly retrospect` first, then read `evidence/derived/*`; treat derived patterns as candidates.
4. Register Mode A material first: run `distilly transcribe` for audio/video, then update the dated folder under `knowledge/research/raw/`.
5. After merging, re-check evidence coverage and the anchor back-reference rate with `distilly doctor`; previously passing checks must still pass.
6. Mode B corrections are logged verbatim in the Correction Log together with the triggering user phrase and timestamp.

## MUST NOT

1. No evidence-free inference: impressions, common sense, and model memory are not conclusions.
2. Never rewrite quotations; long passages, full transcripts, and full subtitles never enter the repository.
3. Never write credentials into chat or files; they are read only from `~/.distilly/*_config.json` or environment variables.
4. Never hand-craft API calls; all network collection goes through `distilly collect`.
5. Never present a candidate as a conclusion.
6. Never cascade edits into layers the user did not correct.

## RECEIPT

- Which files were read, how many rows each, how many anchors.
- Which files were created or updated, each with its sha256 (from the `distilly` `--json` receipt, `knowledge/index.json`, or `evidence/renders/receipt.json`).
- Which channels were unavailable (`unavailable[]`).
- Which steps were skipped, and why.
